Command Line API
================

# What is this?

This is a simple library that allows you to structure command line applications similarly to how you would write a REST api.

# Why?

Writing command line applications always frustrated me. The translation of CLI args infected the code. The mixture of logging and helpful output is gross. I love the CLI and with node, nothing felt good.
